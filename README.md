# ATM Interface

Welcome to the ATM Interface project! This Java console application simulates an ATM machine, providing users with options such as withdrawing, depositing, and checking the balance. Below are the key features and instructions for using the ATM Interface:

1. **ATM Class:**
   - The project includes a class representing the ATM machine, providing functionalities for options like withdrawing, depositing, and checking the balance.

2. **User Interface:**
   - Design a simple console-based user interface that prompts users to choose options such as withdrawing, depositing, and checking the balance.

3. **Methods Implementation:**
   - Implement methods in the ATM class for each option, such as `withdraw(amount)`, `deposit(amount)`, and `checkBalance()`.

4. **Bank Account Class:**
   - Create a class representing the user's bank account, which stores the account balance.

5. **Connection with ATM Class:**
   - Connect the ATM class with the user's bank account class to access and modify the account balance.

6. **User Input Validation:**
   - Validate user input to ensure it is within acceptable limits (e.g., sufficient balance for withdrawals).

7. **Display Messages:**
   - Display appropriate messages to the user based on their chosen options and the success or failure of their transactions.
